TOM: Juan, you mention using a gist for one's article. What text format
should that be in?

JUAN: It uses markdown. But you don't need to use gist for everything, just
for the code. It's very convenient, you don't have to process it, and
it renders a decent highlight.

TOM: I am still trying to figure out the best way to put an article on
Wordpress--I hate that editor!

JUAN: Right, not very good. What I do is to write in markdown, copy and
paste from the rendered HTML, and then add the code fragments in gists
by hand.

TOM: If you haven't tried it out yet, check out DEV (https://dev.to). I
love the editor there. I think we should self-host our own version but
others disagree.

JUAN: It's free software... But self-hosting is not very
sustainable. Yep, I've tried it, https://dev.to/JJ. Not writing so
much stuff lately...
